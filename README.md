URLSUCKER sucks all embedded URLs from a given URI or file.

Ideal to parse strings from CSS or JS as many or all the web crawlers and spiders do not scan through JavaScript code skipping many interesting resources such as API calls, webservices, etc.

Useful to pentest Web Applications.

It could be integrated to ZAP or Burp Suite as well. 

DISCLAMER: Still alpha phase. Returns some false positives as searches extensively for strings that seem URLs (nonetheless this is better than traditional web crawlers that skip many URLs embedded into JavaScript code).
